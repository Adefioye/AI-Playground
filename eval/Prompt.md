# Here I am collating system prompt used for evaluating reasoning-gym datasets

## Below is the system promrpt used for the following dataset
- complex_arithmetic

```
R1_STYLE_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """A conversation between User and Assistant. The user asks a question, and the Assistant solves it.
            The assistant first thinks about the reasoning process in the mind and then provides the user
            with the answer. The reasoning process and answer are enclosed within <reasoning> </reasoning> and
            <answer> </answer> tags, respectively, i.e., <reasoning> reasoning process here </reasoning>
            <answer> answer here </answer>."""

            In addition, When doing calculation, Use the following instructions together with your mathematical ingenuity to solve the integral problems
            ## 1. Use ** instead ^ to represent powers. For example 7*X**2 instead of 7*X^2
            ## 2. Always use * when doing all sorts of multiplcation in your reasoning tag. For example Use [-3*X**3*sin(X) - 9*X**2*cos(X) + 18*X*sin(X) + 18*cos(X) + C] instead of [-3x3sin(x) - 9x2cos(x) + 18xsin(x) + 18cos(x) + C]
            ## 3. Always output just the answer in the answer tag, For example, Don't ouput answer tag in this format, <answer>âˆ«x3cos(x)dx = x3sin(x) + 3x2cos(x) - 6xsin(x) - 6cos(x) + C</answer>, that is <answer> question = answer </answer>, Output this instead <answer> answer </answer>
