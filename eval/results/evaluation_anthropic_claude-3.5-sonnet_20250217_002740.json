All other cells die or stay dead\n\nI'll check each cell's neighbors (including diagonals) and apply these rules.\nLooking at each position:\n- For corners: check 3 neighbors\n- For edges: check 5 neighbors\n- For middle cells: check all 8 neighbors\n\nFor each cell, I'll:\n1. Count live neighbors\n2. Apply rules based on current state and neighbor count\n3.
