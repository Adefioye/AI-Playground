        "model_answer": "<reasoning>\nSince the kernel size is 1:\n1. This is actually a special case where no pooling will occur because:\n   - A 1x1 kernel means we're looking at each element individually\n   - With stride equal to kernel size (1), we move one position at a time\n   - Each element will be compared with itself in the max operation\n2. Therefore, the output matrix will be identical to the input matrix\n3. This is because:\n   - Each 1x1 region contains just one number\n   - The maximum of a single number is the number itself\n   - We move through every element in the matrix\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\n3 4 6 5 8 2\n1 7 8 0 7 6\n4 1 6 8 6 6\n</answer>",
