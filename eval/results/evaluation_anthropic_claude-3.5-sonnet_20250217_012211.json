Given that the stride equals the kernel size (3), there won't be any overlapping regions.\n\n3. However, the input matrix is only 3x2, which is smaller than the required 3x3 kernel size.\n\n4. In this case, the entire matrix will be considered as one region (padding is not mentioned, so we'll use what we have).\n\n5. To perform max pooling, I need to find the maximum value in the region:\n   6 3\n   7 4\n   6 9\n   \n   The maximum value among these numbers is 9.\n\n6. Since the kernel size is 3 and covers the entire matrix, the output will be a single value.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>9</answer>",
