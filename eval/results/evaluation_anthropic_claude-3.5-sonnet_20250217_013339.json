For 90-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - First row becomes last column\n   - Second row becomes second-to-last column\n   - And so on...\n\n2. For 270-degree clockwise rotation:\n   - This is equivalent to rotating 90 degrees three times\n   - Or we can do it directly:\n   - First column becomes first row (in reverse)\n   - Second column becomes second row (in reverse)\n   - And so on...\n\nFor the given 10x10 matrix, 270\u00b0 clockwise rotation means:\n- Take each column from left to right\n- Make it a row (in reverse order)\n- These become the rows of the new matrix from top to bottom\n\nThe first row of the result will be the first column read from bottom to top\nThe second row will be the second column read from bottom to top\nAnd so on...\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n23 66 79 38 64 90 62 70 29 87\n65 82 57 18 80 6 25 16 26 4\n21 60 69 55 86 98 71 97 5 52\n45 3 41 68 11 58 94 53 42 61\n85 15 10 1 12 9 74 93 91 13\n39 92 27 96 17 88 40 67 7 32\n59 81 89 46 63 54 51 56 47 35\n30 33 75 78 44 37 19 34 14 72\n8 0 43 95 84 49 31 48 24 73\n22 20 2 50 77 36 28 99 83 76\n</answer>",

For 180 degrees:\n- Can be done by rotating 90 degrees twice\n- Or more efficiently: reverse all elements from start to end\n- Can think of it as reversing both rows and columns\n\nFor the given example:\n- It's a 10x10 matrix\n- For 180 degrees rotation:\n  * Each element (i,j) will move to position (n-1-i, n-1-j)\n  * So element at (0,0) moves to (9,9)\n  * Element at (0,1) moves to (9,8)\n  * And so on...\n- We can traverse the matrix and build the result by placing each element in its new position\n\nThe process is like turning the matrix upside down and reversing left to right.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n56 0 32 61 9 86 70 48 63 89\n96 79 34 1 75 95 12 94 51 43\n44 64 30 2 45 24 50 77 91 62\n27 87 53 42 31 49 72 52 71 18\n23 97 19 93 36 76 8 17 26 81\n39 21 90 7 59 82 73 22 74 41\n15 57 29 20 88 11 28 66 84 4\n40 35 16 25 6 38 3 33 37 13\n14 67 5 80 54 10 46 68 47 60\n65 58 99 55 92 69 98 85 78 83\n</answer>",
