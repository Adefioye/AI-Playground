The pattern will be:\n   - Move right until the end of current row\n   - Move down until the end of current column\n   - Move left until the start of current row\n   - Move up until the start of current column\n   - Repeat with reduced boundaries\n\n3. Following this pattern:\n   - First outer layer: \n     Right: 0,8,5,6,7,0,9,4,3,7\n     Down: 7,9,9,3,0\n     Left: 3,9,2,9,4,8,0,2\n     Up: 0,0,8,5,2\n\n   - Second layer:\n     Right: 0,1,5,0,6,8,5,2\n     Down: 7,2,8,0\n     Left: 3,7,3,1\n     Up: 1,1,7,2\n\n   - Third layer:\n     Right: 2,8,8,8,2,5\n     Down: 7,2\n     Left: 2,8\n     Up: 8,8\n\n   - Fourth layer:\n     Right: 4,0,6\n     Down: 2\n     Left: 0\n     Up: 8\n\n   - Center: 8\n\n4.
