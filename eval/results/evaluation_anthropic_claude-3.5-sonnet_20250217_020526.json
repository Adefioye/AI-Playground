Possible approach:\n   - First, let's try to get rid of the double 'Z'\n   - 'JAZZ' -> 'JARS' (change Z to R)\n   - 'JARS' -> 'DARS' (change J to D)\n   - 'DARS' -> 'DORM' (change ARS to ORM)\n\n3. Let me verify each transition:\n   - JAZZ is a valid word\n   - JARS is a valid word (containers)\n   - DARS isn't a valid English word - need a different approach\n\n4. Let's try another route:\n   - JAZZ -> JAZS (not valid)\n   - Need different approach\n\n5. New attempt:\n   - JAZZ -> JACK (valid)\n   - JACK -> DARK (valid)\n   - DARK -> DORK (valid)\n   - DORK -> DORM (valid)\n\n6. This sequence works!

Looking at the differences:\n   - First letter S stays the same\n   - Second letter N needs to change to U\n   - Third letter O needs to change to Q\n   - Fourth letter G needs to change to S\n\n3. This is difficult because:\n   - We need valid English words at each step\n   - Q is an uncommon letter\n   - We need to get to a word ending in QS\n\n4. After trying various combinations, I cannot find a valid path where:\n   - Each intermediate step is a valid English word\n   - Only one letter changes at each step\n   - We reach 'SUQS'\n\n5. In fact, 'SUQS' itself is not a standard English word, which makes this puzzle impossible to solve with valid English words.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>IMPOSSIBLE</answer>",
