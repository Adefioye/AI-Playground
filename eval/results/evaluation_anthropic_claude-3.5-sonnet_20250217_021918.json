        "model_answer": "<reasoning>\nLooking at the examples, I notice several patterns:\n1. In Example 1, there's a long sequence of 9s that becomes just two 9s (at the start and end of the sequence)\n2. In Example 2, a sequence of six 3s becomes just two 3s (at the start and end)\n3. In Example 3, a sequence of eight 5s becomes just two 5s (at the start and end)\n\nThe common rule appears to be:\n- When there's a continuous sequence of the same non-zero number, keep only the first and last occurrence of that number in the sequence\n- All other numbers in between become 0\n- Numbers that are already 0 remain 0\n- The transformation preserves the position of the first and last number in each sequence\n\nFor the test input:\n- There's a sequence of nineteen 2s followed by seven 0s\n- Following the rule, we should keep only the first and last 2 in the sequence\n- All other 2s should become 0\n- The existing 0s should remain 0\n</reasoning>\n<answer>2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",
