Looking at Example 1:\n- Input has a sequence of 9's in the middle\n- Output keeps only the first and last 9 of that sequence\n\n2. Looking at Example 2:\n- Input has a sequence of 3's in the middle\n- Output keeps only the first and last 3 of that sequence\n\n3. Looking at Example 3:\n- Input has a sequence of 5's at the start\n- Output keeps only the first and last 5 of that sequence\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n- For any continuous sequence of the same number (excluding 0's)\n- Keep only the first and last number of that sequence\n- Replace all numbers in between with 0's\n- Keep all 0's as they are\n\nFor the test input:\n- There's a sequence of 2's from position 1 to 19\n- Following the rule, we should keep only the first and last 2\n- Replace all other 2's with 0's\n- Keep the remaining 0's as they are\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

When there's a '2' followed by a sequence of identical numbers (except 0), the '2' moves one position to the right and the last number in the sequence becomes 0\n2. If this pattern doesn't exist (like in Example 3), the output remains the same as input\n3. Numbers before the '2' remain unchanged\n\nLooking at the test input:\n9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2\n\nThis case doesn't match our pattern since the '2' is at the end and isn't followed by a sequence of identical numbers. Therefore, following rule #2, the output should be identical to the input.\n</reasoning>\n<answer>9 9 9 9 9 9 9 9 0 0 0 2</answer>",

The output grid is formed by shifting all numbers one position to the right\n2. A zero is added at the beginning (leftmost position)\n3. The last number (rightmost position) of the input is dropped\n\nThis is essentially a right shift operation where:\n- First position becomes 0\n- Each number moves one position to the right\n- Last number is removed\n\nApplying this rule to the test input:\n0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4 6\nbecomes:\n0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4\n</reasoning>\n<answer>0 0 8 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 3 0 0 4</answer>",

Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Describe how you derived the rule and your overall reasoning process in detail before you submit your answer. Your final answer must be placed in <output></output> tags and should be just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4",

        "model_answer": "<reasoning>\nLet me analyze the patterns in the examples:\n\n1. Looking at the input and output grids, I notice that:\n   - The total number of each digit (4s, 7s, or 8s) remains the same\n   - The position of zeros changes\n   - The non-zero numbers get regrouped in a specific way\n\n2. Analyzing the pattern more closely:\n   - In Example 1: 3 eights, then 6 zeros, then 15 eights \u2192 becomes 5 eights, 6 zeros, 13 eights\n   - In Example 2: 4 fours, then 8 zeros, then 12 fours \u2192 becomes 6 fours, 7 zeros, 11 fours\n   - In Example 3: 1 seven, then 9 zeros, then 14 sevens \u2192 becomes 3 sevens, 9 zeros, 12 sevens\n\n3. The rule appears to be:\n   - Take the first group of non-zero numbers\n   - Add 2 more of these numbers immediately after the original group\n   - Shift all zeros to follow this expanded group\n   - Keep the remaining non-zero numbers at the end\n\n4. For the test input:\n   - Initial state: 6 fours, then 13 zeros, then 1 four\n   - According to rule: Need to add 2 more fours after initial group\n   - Result should be: 8 fours, then 13 zeros, then 3 fours\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>4 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 4 4</answer>",

Looking at Example 3:\n   - Input has six 8's in positions 5-10\n   - Output shows these six 8's shifted left to positions 1-6\n\nCommon rules I observe:\n- Non-zero numbers form a continuous block\n- In the output, this block is shifted to the left\n- The block maintains its size (number of digits)\n- All other positions are filled with zeros\n- The shift appears to move the block to start at an earlier position\n\nFor the test input:\n- There are nine 7's in positions 4-12\n- Following the pattern, I should shift this block of 7's to the left\n- The block should maintain its size (nine 7's)\n- All other positions should be zeros\n\nTherefore, the nine 7's should be moved to start at the beginning of the grid, followed by zeros.</reasoning>\n\n<answer>7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

First, I notice that each grid seems to be showing horizontal rows of numbers (with width of 5).\n\n2. Looking at the transformation:\n- Example 1: Shows three 4's at top, then replicates these three 4's twice below\n- Example 2: Shows three 9's at top, then replicates these three 9's three times\n- Example 3: Shows five 5's at top, then replicates these five 5's once below\n\n3. The key pattern I've identified is:\n- When there's a sequence of the same number in the input (horizontally)\n- That same sequence gets replicated below in the output at regular intervals\n- The replication maintains the same length as the original sequence\n\n4. For the test input:\n- We have five 2's in the first row\n- Following the pattern, this sequence of five 2's should be replicated once below\n- Just like Example 3 which had five 5's that got replicated once\n\n5. So the output should show:\n- First row: 2 2 2 2 2\n- Second row: 0 0 0 0 0\n- Third row: 2 2 2 2 2\n- Rest filled with zeros\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>2 2 2 2 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Looking at the input-output pairs:\n   - Example 1: Seven 7's move left and become five 7's\n   - Example 2: Five 7's stay five 7's but move left\n   - Example 3: Eight 4's become eight 4's but move left\n\n2. Key observations:\n   - The non-zero numbers (7s, 4s) always shift to the left\n   - They maintain their sequence length (don't add or remove numbers)\n   - They always start at position 1 in the output (after the first 0)\n   - Any remaining positions are filled with 0s\n   - The first position is always 0 in both input and output\n\n3. The rule appears to be:\n   - Keep the first 0\n   - Take any sequence of non-zero numbers\n   - Move them to start right after the first 0\n   - Fill the rest with 0s\n\n4. For the test input (0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0):\n   - There is one '3'\n   - Following the rule, it should move to position 1 (after first 0)\n   - Rest should be 0s\n</reasoning>\n<answer>0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Looking at the output grids, I notice they all follow a similar pattern:\n   - All 0s appear first\n   - Then all 1s\n   - Finally all 2s\n\n2. The key observation is that the output grids seem to be sorting the numbers (0,1,2) regardless of their position in the input grid.\n\n3. Let's verify by counting numbers in examples:\nExample 1: \n- Input has: 14 zeros, 9 ones, 3 twos\n- Output has: 12 zeros, 12 ones, 2 twos\n\nExample 2:\n- Input has: 9 zeros, 5 ones, 12 twos\n- Output has: 9 zeros, 7 ones, 10 twos\n\nExample 3:\n- Input has: 13 zeros, 4 ones, 9 twos\n- Output has: 12 zeros, 4 ones, 10 twos\n\n4. For the test input, let me count:\n- 16 zeros\n- 6 ones\n- 4 twos\n\n5. The rule appears to be: Sort the numbers in ascending order (0,1,2), maintaining roughly similar proportions of each number from input to output, with some slight adjustments.\n\n6. For the test input with 26 total positions:\n- First ~10 positions should be 0s\n- Next ~8 positions should be 1s\n- Last ~8 positions should be 2s\n</reasoning>\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2</answer>",

Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Describe how you derived the rule and your overall reasoning process in detail before you submit your answer.

Looking at Example 2:\n- Same pattern: the 2 acts as a pivot point\n- All numbers before the 2 shift one position right\n- The 2 is replaced by the first non-zero number that appears after it (9)\n\n3. Looking at Example 3:\n- Confirms the pattern: when there's a 2, it's replaced by whatever constant number appears around it (9)\n- Numbers before the 2 shift one position right\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n1. Find the position of 2 in the input\n2. Take all numbers before the 2 and shift them one position to the right\n3. Replace the 2 with the first non-zero number that appears after it\n\nFor the test input:\n- The 2 is in position 10\n- All zeros before it shift right one position\n- The 2 should be replaced by 3 (the first non-zero number after it)\n</reasoning>\n<answer>0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 0 0</answer>",

Predict the corresponding output grid by applying the rule you found. Describe how you derived the rule and your overall reasoning process in detail before you submit your answer. Your final answer must be placed in <output></output> tags and should be just be the text output grid itself.\n\nInput:\n0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 2 1 2 2 0 0",

Looking at the output grids, I notice they all follow a similar pattern:\n   - They start with some 2's\n   - Then have a sequence of 0's\n   - End with some 1's\n\n2. Looking more closely at the outputs:\n   - The numbers seem to be sorted and grouped\n   - All 2's come first, then all 0's, then all 1's\n\n3. The rule appears to be:\n   - Count how many 2's are in the input grid \u2192 put that many 2's at the start\n   - Fill the middle with 0's\n   - Count how many 1's are in the input grid \u2192 put that many 1's at the end\n\n4. For the test input:\n   - Counting 2's: there are 3 twos (2,2,2)\n   - Counting 1's: there are 5 ones (1,1,1,1,1)\n   - The rest should be filled with 0's\n\n5. Therefore:\n   - Start with three 2's\n   - Fill the middle with fourteen 0's\n   - End with five 1's\n</reasoning>\n<answer>2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1</answer>",

In the output, the only numbers that appear are 0s, 2s, and 8s.\n\n3. Looking at where 8s appear in the output:\n   - They appear at the start of sequences of 2s in the input\n   - It seems that when there are 3 or more consecutive 2s in the input, the first few positions get converted to 8s\n   - The rule appears to be: for any sequence of 3 or more 2s, convert the first (n-2) positions to 8s, where n is the length of the sequence of 2s\n   - The last two 2s in any sequence remain as 2s\n   - Single or pairs of 2s remain unchanged\n   - All 0s remain unchanged\n\n4. For the test input:\n   - First part has 0s which will remain 0s\n   - Then there's a sequence of eight 2s: \"2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\"\n   - Following the rule, first 6 positions should become 8s, last 2 remain 2s\n   - Then more 0s\n   - Then a sequence of four 2s: \"2 2 2 2\"\n   - Following the rule, first 2 positions should become 8s, last 2 remain 2s\n   - Finally, more 0s\n</reasoning>\n\n<answer>\n0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 8 8 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 2 2 0 0 0\n</answer>",

Looking at Example 3:\n   Input:  2(3), 0(5), 1(2)\n   Output: 2(3), 1(2), 0(5)\n\nThe rule appears to be:\n- Count the frequency of each number (0,1,2) in the input\n- In the output:\n  1. Place all 2s first\n  2. Then place all 1s\n  3. Finally place all 0s\n\nFor the test input (0 0 0 2 2 2 0 2 0 0 0):\n- Count: 2(4), 1(0), 0(7)\n- Output should be: four 2s, then no 1s, then seven 0s\n</reasoning>\n<answer>2 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0</answer>",

Example 1: The sequence of eleven 1's shifts right by 4 positions\nExample 2: The sequence of three 5's shifts right by 4 positions\nExample 3: The sequence of thirteen 9's shifts right by 4 positions\n\n3. The common rule appears to be:\n- Any continuous sequence of non-zero numbers shifts 4 positions to the right\n- The length of the sequence remains the same\n- The values in the sequence remain the same\n- The rest of the positions are filled with zeros\n\n4. For the test input:\n- There is a sequence of four 8's starting at position 13\n- Following the rule, this sequence should shift 4 positions to the right\n- So the 8's should start at position 17\n- All other positions should be 0\n\n</reasoning>\n<output>\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 8 8 8 0 0 0 0 0 0\n</output>",

Looking at the sequences, in each case there is a continuous string of non-zero numbers (either 7s, 8s, or 4s) surrounded by zeros.\n\n2. In each example:\n- The length of the non-zero sequence remains the same between input and output\n- The non-zero sequence appears to shift left in the output\n- The shift appears to be 3 positions to the left\n\n3. For example:\n- In Example 1: The sequence of 7s starts at position 17 in input, shifts to position 14 in output\n- In Example 2: The sequence of 8s starts at position 6 in input, shifts to position 3 in output\n- In Example 3: The sequence of 4s starts at position 9 in input, shifts to position 6 in output\n\n4. Looking at the test input:\n- There is a sequence of seven 8s starting at position 10\n- Following the pattern, this sequence should shift 3 positions left\n- So in the output, the sequence should start at position 7\n\n5.
