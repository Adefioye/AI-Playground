First, I'll identify all Fridays between these dates:\n* August 21, 2022 was a Sunday\n* The first Friday after that would be August 26\n* Then September 2, 9, 16, 23, 30\n* And one more on October 3 doesn't include a Friday\n\n2. Counting the Fridays:\n* August: 1 Friday (26th)\n* September: 5 Fridays (2, 9, 16, 23, 30)\n* October: 0 Fridays (since October 3 is Monday)\n\n3. Total count: 1 + 5 + 0 = 6 Fridays\n</reasoning>\n<answer>6</answer>",
