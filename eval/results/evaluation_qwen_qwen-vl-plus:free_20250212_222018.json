In this case, a = 86, b = -2, and c = -13. Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get b = [2 \u00b1 sqrt((-2)^2 - 4*86*(-13))] / (2*86). Simplifying this expression, we get b = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4 + 4568)] / 172. Further simplifying, we get b = [2 \u00b1 sqrt(4572)] / 172. Since the square root of 4572 is not a perfect square, we cannot simplify this expression any further. Therefore, the real values of b that satisfy the equation are b = [2 + sqrt(4572)] / 172 and b = [2 - sqrt(4572)] / 172. To find the decimal values of these expressions, we can use a calculator. Plugging in the values, we get b = [2 + 67.7461] / 172 and b = [2 - 67.7461] / 172. Simplifying these expressions, we get b = 0.0623 and b = -0.3977.

First, we add 41 to both sides of the equation to get -132*p**2 = 41. Then, we divide both sides by -132 to get p**2 = 41/132. Finally, we take the square root of both sides to get p = \u00b1sqrt(41/132). We can simplify this expression by rationalizing the denominator: p = \u00b1sqrt(41/132) * sqrt(132/132) = \u00b1sqrt(41*132/132^2) = \u00b1sqrt(41/132) * sqrt(132) = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(41) * sqrt(132)/132 = \u00b1sqrt(4",

This gives us two possible solutions: h = 0 or -71*h**2 + 182 = 0. Solving the second equation for h, we get h**2 = 182/71, which gives us h = sqrt(182/71) or h = -sqrt(182/71).
