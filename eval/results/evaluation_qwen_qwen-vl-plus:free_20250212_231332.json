We can do this by iterating through each cell in the matrix and checking the distance to the nearest 0 in all four directions (up, down, left, and right). We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to find the shortest path to a 0 from each cell. The BFS algorithm starts at each cell and explores all adjacent cells in all four directions, keeping track of the number of steps taken to reach a 0. The cell with the smallest number of steps is the cell with the nearest 0. We can use a queue to keep track of the cells to be explored and a visited set to keep track of the cells that have already been explored. We can also use a distance matrix to keep track of the distance to the nearest 0 for each cell. We can initialize the distance matrix with infinity for all cells and set the distance to 0 for all cells that are 0. We can then use the BFS algorithm to explore all cells and update the distance matrix with the minimum distance to a 0.

We start by marking all the 0s in the matrix as visited and then perform a BFS from each 0 cell. For each cell, we calculate the distance to the nearest 0 by adding 1 to the distance of the cell's neighbors that have already been visited. We repeat this process for all the cells in the matrix. The output will be the matrix with the taxicab distance of the nearest 0 for each cell.</reasoning>\n<answer>[[0, 0, 0, 1], [1, 1, 1, 2], [2, 2, 2, 3], [3, 3, 3, 0]]</answer>",
