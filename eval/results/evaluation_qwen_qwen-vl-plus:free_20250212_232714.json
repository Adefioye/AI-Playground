The given text is \"JNJUBUF ZPVS BTTPDJBUF XIPN J XBT DPNQMJNFOUJOH B NPNFOU BHP\". Since the text is in English, we can assume the shift is 13 (the number of letters in the alphabet). We shift each letter back by 13 positions. For example, 'J' becomes 'A', 'N' becomes 'M', and so on.

The shift is usually a constant value, often 3 or 5. Without knowing the exact shift value, we can't decrypt the text. However, if we assume a common shift value of 3, we can try decrypting the text.
