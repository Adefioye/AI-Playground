        "model_answer": "<reasoning>To determine if two strings are isomorphic, we need to check if each character in the first string can be replaced with a character in the second string such that the order of characters is preserved and no two characters map to the same character. We can do this by creating two dictionaries, one for each string, where the keys are the characters in the first string and the values are the corresponding characters in the second string. If the same character appears in both dictionaries, it means that the same character in the first string is mapped to two different characters in the second string, which violates the isomorphic condition. If the dictionaries are equal, it means that each character in the first string is mapped to a unique character in the second string, and vice versa, which satisfies the isomorphic condition. In this case, we can see that 'k' maps to 'z' and 'w' maps to 'w', which satisfies the isomorphic condition. Therefore, the answer is True.</reasoning>\n<answer>True</answer>",
