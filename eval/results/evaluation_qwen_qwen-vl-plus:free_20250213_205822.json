In this case, we will use the Newton-Raphson method to find the roots of the equation. The Newton-Raphson method is an iterative method that uses the derivative of the function to find the roots of the equation. We will start with an initial guess for the root and then use the Newton-Raphson formula to find the next approximation. We will continue this process until we find the root to a desired level of accuracy. After finding the root, we will check if it is a real number or not. If it is a real number, we will add it to the list of real roots. If it is not a real number, we will discard it. We will repeat this process until we find all the real roots of the equation.
